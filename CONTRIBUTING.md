## Testing
1. Catcord uses docker and docker-compose for deployment and testing, so make sure that you have a docker ready environment.
2. Build the docker image by running `docker-compose build`.
3. Run the docker image by running `docker-compose up`.

## Linting
Make sure to lint your code before you push. Our backend uses the `black` Python formatter to keep a consistent style throughout our code. You can install black with `pip` and run `black filename.py` to format your code. For the frontend, we use ESLint, for which you can simply run `yarn lint`.
