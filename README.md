Welcome to _Catcord_. Catcord is a minimal chat application created by the Cat Dev Team, that ships with a minimal default interface. In essence, Catcord is just a set of endpoints, and anyone can create a client to interact with these endpoints. Catcord's default client is built using SvelteKit and Tauri.
